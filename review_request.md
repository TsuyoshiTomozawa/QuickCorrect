# Code Review Request

## Changes Made to Fix TypeScript Errors

### 1. Updated `src/renderer/__tests__/AppWithTheme.test.tsx`
- Removed unused import: `fireEvent` from '@testing-library/react'
- Kept `React` import as it's needed for JSX

### 2. Updated `tsconfig.json`
- Added `"types": ["jest", "node"]` to compilerOptions to include Jest type definitions

## Original Errors
```
